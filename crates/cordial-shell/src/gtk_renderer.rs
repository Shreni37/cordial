//! Which renderer GTK draws the host window with, decided before it asks.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** The engine's window is a GTK toplevel with the canvas
//! as a subsurface, and a focused TextBox is drawn by GTK over the game
//! (ADR-047). With no working Vulkan the engine falls back to GLES3 in the same
//! process as GTK, GTK falls back to its GL renderer, and from then on GTK
//! never attaches a buffer to the window again: no frame, no editor, whatever
//! the stacking does. `GSK_RENDERER=cairo` takes GTK off that path and was
//! measured to present normally on the same reproduction (issue #53, nested
//! KWin, `VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/nonexistent`).
//!
//! The window holds a header bar and a transparent hole where the canvas
//! shows, so software drawing costs nothing worth the name, and this chooses
//! it for exactly the machines that would otherwise get nothing.
//!
//! **Why the Vulkan probe and not the Graphics setting.** What breaks GTK is
//! that *GTK* has no Vulkan to render with, not that the engine took GLES:
//! forcing the engine to GLES on a machine whose Vulkan works leaves GTK on
//! Vulkan and presenting (ADR-047), so `CORDIAL_GRAPHICS=gles` alone is not a
//! reason. The question is whether a hardware Vulkan device exists, which is
//! what [`crate::vulkan_probe`] already answers in a child process.
//!
//! **When it runs.** The probe starts in `cordial-run`'s `main`, concurrent
//! with everything the client does before the engine asks for its window, and
//! [`settle`] collects it there. On a healthy machine that is no added
//! startup latency: the child finishes long before the window is wanted. A
//! user's own `GSK_RENDERER` skips the probe entirely.
